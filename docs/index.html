<p>Since a young age I always enjoyed developing, I taught myself how to code in various languages and, more importantly, how to approach new platform and new technologies. I crave learning and I see a challenging project as an opportunity to expand my knowledge.</p>
<p>Through my own incentive and drive I created several websites and apps, some of which used millions of people all over the world.</p>
</div><div class="job"><h2>Android Developer - ViewRanger (2014-2017)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developing and maintaining the Android version of the App</li>
<li>Developing the communication system for the Wear Application</li>
<li>Developing a new map engine</li>
</ul>
<p>When I joined ViewRanger my first task was to overhaul the whole UI and bring it up to date to match the latest Material Design guideline. After a huge effort we were rewarded by Google with the title of Top Developer.</p>
<p>After that we started to improve the inner workings of the app with the bleeding edge of the available libraries such as Retrofit and RxJava.</p>
<p>Thanks to our efforts we were able to add new and exciting features to the app such as Augmented Reality and powerful Wear application.</p>
</div><div class="job"><h2>UX Developer - Bango (2012-2014)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developing and maintaining the App Stores(Mozilla and in-house)</li>
<li>Developing and maintaining the various Analytics Dashboards</li>
<li>Integrate Carrier APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>While the title is UX Developer, my role was more one of a full stack web developer working on all levels of the website; from back-end (MSSQL, C#, ASP.NET) to the front-end (raw JS with jQuery).</p>
<p>In this role I was able to develop my C# skills and knowledge of the .NET framework while learning about concepts like MVC, dependency injection and other useful patterns.</p>
<p>I also learnt to work in an Agile environment and had the opportunity to develop for companies such as Mozilla and Facebook.</p>
</div><div class="job"><h2>Software Developer - MEGA (2009-2011)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developing software on PLC for industrial packaging machines</li>
<li>Remote assistance to installed machines</li>
<li>Installation and servicing of machines</li>
</ul>
<p>At MEGA I developed mostly in Step 7 for Siemens PLCs, while not exactly the same thing of programming mobile apps I learnt a lot about the value of good documentation, code cleanliness and safety. Crashing a 5 ton machine is not the same as crashing a server.</p>
<p>I also had to install and service the machines for which I had to learn the basics of electronics and mechanical engineering.</p>
