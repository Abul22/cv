## Explanation
Why create a single web page CV in Webpack? Overkill? Maybe, but I wanted to experiment with Webpack and learn more about server-side rendering. It's also a lot simpler to edit this way.

The intent of the project was to generate a static webpage by using useful tools such as Markdown for the main content, Pug for the layout and Sass for the styles. Webpack ties it all together nicely.


## Contribution
You can contribute to this project by hiring me! The experience I gain with you will go on here! 

Feel free to take the layout and put your data in. You can modify src/sidebar.md with your details and jobs/*.md will change the main content
