## Software Developer - MEGA (2009-2011)

* Developing software on PLC for industrial packaging machines
* Remote assistance to installed machines
* Installation and servicing of machines

At MEGA I developed mostly in Step 7 for Siemens PLCs, while not exactly the same thing of programming mobile apps I learnt a lot about the value of good documentation, code cleanliness and safety. Crashing a 5 ton machine is not the same as crashing a server. 

I also had to install and service the machines for which I had to learn the basics of electronics and mechanical engineering.
