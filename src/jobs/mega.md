## Software Developer - MEGA (2009 - 2012)

* Developed software on PLC for industrial packaging machines
* Provided remote assistance to installed machines
* Installed and serviced machines

At MEGA, I mostly coded in Step 7 for Siemens PLCs, while not the same thing of programming mobile apps I learnt a lot about good documentation, code cleanliness and safety.

I also had to install and service the machines for which I had to learn the basics of electronics and mechanical engineering.
