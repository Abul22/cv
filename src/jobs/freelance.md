## Freelance

From a young age I always enjoyed developing; I taught myself how to code in various languages and, more importantly, how to build upon new platforms and new technologies. I crave learning and approach a challenging project as an opportunity to expand my knowledge.

Through my personal incentive and drive, I created several websites and apps, some of which are used by millions of people all over the world.

I was the first person to create an Android App for Imgur when it didn't have an API yet and since then I always strive to keep myself up to date with the latest best practices.
