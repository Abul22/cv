## Freelance

Since a young age I always enjoyed developing, I taught myself how to code in various languages and, more importantly, how to approach new platform and new technologies. I crave learning and I see a challenging project as an opportunity to expand my knowledge.

Through my own incentive and drive I created several websites and apps, some of which used millions of people all over the world.
