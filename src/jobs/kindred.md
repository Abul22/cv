## Web Developer - 32Red Brand of Kindred Group (2018 - 2019)

* Develop the new Event Insight service
* Create and maintain new promotions
* Integrated new version of the game APIs

In my role at 32Red I have been able to expand on my existing knowledge of PHP and Frontend Frameworks.
In the process of building the new tools for the company I had the opportunity to focus
on writing more tests and enforcing best practices that then went to improve the general quality of the other projects.
