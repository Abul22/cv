## UX Developer - Bango (2012-2014)

* Developing and maintaining the App Stores(Mozilla and in-house)
* Developing and maintaining the various Analytics Dashboards
* Integrate Carrier APIs

While the title is UX Developer, my role was more one of a full stack web developer working on all levels of the website; from back-end (MSSQL, C#, ASP.NET) to the front-end (raw JS with jQuery).

In this role I was able to develop my C# skills and knowledge of the .NET framework while learning about concepts like MVC, dependency injection and other useful patterns.

I also learnt to work in an Agile environment and had the opportunity to develop for companies such as Mozilla and Facebook.
