## UX Developer - Bango (2012 - 2014)

* Built the App Stores (Mozilla and in-house)
* Maintained various Analytics Dashboards
* Integrated Carrier APIs

While my title was UX Developer, my role was more that of a full stack web developer working on all levels of the platform, from back-end (MSSQL, C#, ASP.NET) to front-end (raw JS with jQuery).

In this role I was able to strengthen my C# skills and knowledge of the .NET framework while learning about concepts like MVC, dependency injection and other useful patterns.

I also learnt to work in an Agile environment and had the opportunity to develop for companies such as Mozilla and Facebook.
