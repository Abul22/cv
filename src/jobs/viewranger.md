## Android Developer - ViewRanger (2014-2017)

* Developing and maintaining the Android version of the App
* Developing the communication system for the Wear Application
* Developing a new map engine

When I joined ViewRanger my first task was to overhaul the whole UI and bring it up to date to match the latest Material Design guideline. After a huge effort we were rewarded by Google with the title of Top Developer.

After that we started to improve the inner workings of the app with the bleeding edge of the available libraries such as Retrofit and RxJava.

Thanks to our efforts we were able to add new and exciting features to the app such as Augmented Reality and powerful Wear application.
