## Android Developer - ViewRanger (2014 - 2018)

* Developed and maintained the Android version of the App
* Designed the communication protocol for the Wear Application
* Created a new map rendering engine with Canvas API
* Implemented a 3D engine for Augmented Reality in OpenGL ES

When I joined ViewRanger my first task was to overhaul the whole UI and bring it up to date with the latest Material Design guidelines. After a huge effort, Google rewarded us with the title of Top Developer.

Following this, we started to improve the inner workings of the app with the bleeding edge of the available libraries such as Retrofit and RxJava.

Thanks to our efforts, we were able to add new and exciting features to the app, including Augmented Reality and a powerful Wear application.
